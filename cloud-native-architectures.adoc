== Cloud Native Application Architectures
:experimental:

Developing applications that are reactive, imperative, event driven, and polyglot are all requirements of modern application architecture. While cloud infrastructure and container Kubernetes solutions, such as Red Hat OpenStack Platform and Red Hat OpenShift, provide a robust infrastructure foundation for distributed environments, similar seamless application services require building applications that take full advantage of such an infrastructure.

Moreover, applications require hybrid and multi cloud architecture to thrive in the digital economy. A unified cloud native application environment has become essential to developers because it enables higher productivity and innovation with a full, cohesive development platform. An application environment is equally critical to operations because of the rapid change and high demands for scalability, agility, and reliability.

In this module, we will learn what cloud-native architecture we need to design for running containerized applications on DevOps/Cloud Native platform in scale and speed. Then we will also develop cloud native applications based on architecture patterns such as high-performing cache, event-driven/reactive, and serverless using https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/cloud-computing/openshift/application-runtimes[Red Hat Runtimes], https://developers.redhat.com/products/codeready-workspaces/overview[Red Hat CodeReady Workspaces^] and https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/cloud-computing/openshift[Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform].

=== Capabilities of a Cloud Native Application Architectures?

The benefits of cloud native application architectures enable speed of development and deployment, flexibility, quality, and reliability. More importantly, it allows developers to integrate the applications with the latest open source technologies without a steep learning curve. While there are many ways to build and architect cloud native applications following are some great ingredients for consideration:

* *Runtimes* - More likely to be written in the container first or/and Kubernetes native language, which means runtimes such as Java, Node.js, Go, Python, and Ruby, etc.
* *Security* - Deploying and maintaining applications in a multi cloud, hybrid cloud application environment, security becomes of utmost importance and should be part of the environment.
* *Observability* - The ability to observer applications and their behavior in the cloud. Tools that can give realtime metrics, and more information about the use e.g., Prometheus, Grafana, Kiali, etc.
* *Efficiency* - Focused on tiny memory footprint, small artifact size, and fast booting time to make portable applications across hybrid/multi-cloud platforms. Primarily, it will leverage an expected spice in production via rapid scaling with consuming minimal computing resources.
* *Interoperability* - Easy to integrate cloud native apps with the latest open source technologies such as Infinispan, MicroProfile, Hibernate, Apache Kafka, Jaeger, Prometheus, and more for building standard runtimes architecture.
* *DevOps/DevSecOps* - Designed for continuous deployment to production in line with the minimum viable product (MVP), with security as part of the tooling together with development, automating testing, and collaboration.

=== How to build Cloud Native applications and architecture with Red Hat?

`Red Hat Runtime​s​` is a recommended set of products, tools, and components to develop and maintain cloud-native applications. It provides lightweight runtimes and frameworks for highly-distributed cloud environments such as microservices, with in-memory caching for fast data access, and messaging for quick data transfer supporting existing applications.

Red Hat Runtime​s​ products and components:

Red Hat Runtimes​​ also provide integrated and optimized products and components to deliver modern applications, whether the goal is to keep existing applications or create new ones. Applications Runtimes enable developers to containerize applications with a microservices architecture, improve data access speed via in-memory data caching, enhance application performance with messaging, or adapt cloud-native application development using modern development patterns and technologies.

Additionally, we have also chosen to use Quarkus for most of the applications in the labs. Read on to learn more about Quarkus.

For years, the client-server architecture has been the de-facto standard to build applications. But a major shift happened. The one model rules them all age is over. A new range of applications and architecture styles has emerged and impacts how code is written and how applications are deployed and executed. HTTP microservices, reactive applications, message-driven microservices and serverless are now central players in modern systems.

https://Quarkus.io/[Qurakus] offers 4 major benefits to build cloud-native, microservices, and serverless Java applicaitons:

* _Developer Joy_ - Cohesive platform for optimized developer joy through unified configuration, Zero config with live reload in the blink of an eye, streamlined code for the 80% common usages with flexible for the 20%, and no hassle native executable generation.
* _Unifies Imperative and Reactive_ - Inject the EventBus or the Vertx context for both Reactive and imperative development in the same application.
* _Functions as a Service and Serverless_ - Superfast startup and low memory utilization. With Quarkus, you can embrace this new world without having to change your programming language.
* _Best of Breed Frameworks & Standards_ - CodeReady Workspaces Vert.x, Hibernate, RESTEasy, Apache Camel, CodeReady Workspaces MicroProfile, Netty, Kubernetes, OpenShift, Jaeger, Prometheus, Apacke Kafka, Infinispan, and more.

=== Getting Ready for the labs

==== If this is the first module you are doing today

You will be using Red Hat CodeReady Workspaces, an online IDE based on https://www.eclipse.org/che/[Eclipe Che^]. *Changes to files are auto-saved every few seconds*, so you don’t need to explicitly save changes.

To get started, {{ ECLIPSE_CHE_URL }}[access the Che instance^] and log in using the username and password you’ve been assigned (e.g. `{{ USER_ID }}/{{ CHE_USER_PASSWORD }}`):

image::che-login.png[cdw, 700]

Once you log in, you’ll be placed on your personal dashboard. Click on the name of the pre-created workspace on the left, as shown below (the name will be different depending on your assigned number). You can also click on the name of the workspace in the center, and then click on the green button that says _Open_ on the top right hand side of the screen.

After a minute or two, you’ll be placed in the workspace:
